# Write a C program to capture the key strokes of capital letters.
-   I wrote the similar code which was given in the lab Exercise 9,
-   In my keylogger.c file, I have removed the code which records keypress when Shift is not pressed.
-   When I type the key when shift is pressed, it gets recorded i.e. Capital Letters.
-   I didn't change any thing in kbduskemap.h file, i only modified the keylogger.c file in such a way to print only CAPITAL letters in the log file
